## ABC Insurance Customer Churn Analysis
# Project Overview
ABC Insurance, once a market leader, is experiencing a steady increase in customer churn alongside stagnant customer lifetime value. The companyâ€™s CEO has tasked the marketing department with understanding and addressing the root causes of this issue by analyzing customer data. The objective of this project is to unearth hidden patterns within the customer data that can help ABC Insurance tailor its product offerings, improve customer engagement, and reduce churn.
